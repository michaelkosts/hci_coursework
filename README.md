This repository hosts the online figma portfolio for the **LZSCC.241 Human–Computer Interaction Project**.  
The project explores, designs, prototypes, and evaluates an application for **managing and modding video game save files** (e.g., backing up saves, restoring old states, and safely editing in-game values).
